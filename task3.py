##### Task 3
When shopping, we pay 12% combined GST and PST on many items.  Write a program that asks the user to enter in the 
prices of 4 items that they are buying.  Find the total price, the amount of tax and the overall price.  
Taxes are rounded appropriately

example:
Enter the first price: 11.99
Enter the second price: 14.76
Enter the third price: 12.99
Enter the fourth price: 15.98
Enter the fift price: 7.99
Your subtotal is $63.71 and your taxes total $7.65 for a total of $71.36
