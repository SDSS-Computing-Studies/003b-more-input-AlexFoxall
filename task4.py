Today we picked apple from _PERSON_'s Orchard. 
I had no idea there were so many different varieties of apples. 
I ate _ADJECTIVE_ apples straight off the tree that tasted like _FOOD_. 
Then there was a _ADJECTIVE_ apple that looked like a _NOUN_.  
When our bag was full, we went on a free hay ride to _PLACE_ and back. 
It ended at a hay pile where we got to _VERB_ _ADVERB_. 
I can hardly wait to get home and cook with the apples. We are going to make apple _FOOD_ and _THINGS_ pies!
